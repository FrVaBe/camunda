# camunda-user-task-demo


This module demonstrate the use of UserTasks.

In particular it addresses the problem of using a [Timer Boundary Event](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/bpmn20/events/timer-events/#timer-boundary-event) to trigger an action when the [Follow Up Date](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/bpmn20/tasks/user-task/#follow-up-date) of a User Task is reached.
